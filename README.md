# Guessing_Ball_Order_Game
### What is the app about?
* This is a Java application that I did for my first assignment in Programming 1. It's a game of guessing the order of balls given in the ring. On the left hand side, there is a list of balls provided for the player to check if his/her is right or wrong. When the player makes a guess, if a white ball appears on the left side, that means the guessed ball is in the ring but not the right order. On the other hand, if the black ball appears, that means the guessed ball is in the right order. If no balls appear at all, the guessed ball is not in the ring.
### How to run the application?
* This is just a simple Java application so that users just need to have any Java IDE such as NetBeans, download the zip file of the repository, extract it and open it in the IDE.
