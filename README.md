# Guessing_Ball_Order_Game
### What is the app about?
* This is a Java application that I did for my first assignment in Programming 1. It's a game of guessing the order of balls given in the ring. On the left hand side, there is a list of balls provided for the player to check if his/her is right or wrong. When the player makes a guess, if a white ball appears on the left side, that means the guessed ball is in the ring but not the right order. On the other hand, if the black ball appears, that means the guessed ball is in the right order. If no balls appear at all, the guessed ball is not in the ring.
